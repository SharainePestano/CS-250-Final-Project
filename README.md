Sprint Review & Retrospective: SNHU Travel Project

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by collaborating closely with stakeholders and converting their goals into detailed user stories. Writing user stories like "As a user, I want to view top-rated destinations" helped define clear, actionable tasks for developers. These stories allowed us to prioritize features, define acceptance criteria, and ensure each sprint delivered real value aligned with user expectations.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I take an iterative and user-focused approach to development. I start by breaking down large features into manageable tasks, using sprints to deliver value incrementally. I plan to continue using Agile processes such as daily standups, sprint planning, retrospectives, and backlog grooming. These practices help maintain team alignment, adapt to changes, and ensure continuous improvement.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member communicates clearly, collaborates respectfully, and shares responsibility for quality outcomes. During this project, I facilitated daily meetings, helped resolve blockers, and supported other team members. Being proactive, responsive to feedback, and adaptable to change helped ensure our team’s success under the Scrum-Agile model.
